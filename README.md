CS10 2023 Final Project: Mapping the Solar System
======
# Project Description
The Astronomy API provides information about the sky coordinates of objects of the Solar System and their distance. These two pieces of information are the only things required to make a crude map of the solar system at a given time.

# Dependencies
This script is dependent on the ajax module, but there is no need to download it as it is web-hosted!

# Running the Script
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the js directory
- If on Mac: run the command `open solar_system_map.html`
- If on Ubuntu: run the command `Firefox solar_system_map.html` (or any browser in place of Firefox)
- Type in a date and time at the prompt
- Press heliocentric to display the solar system with the Sun in the middle
- The geocentric button places the Earth in the middle
- Zoom in and zoom out buttons do as they say!
